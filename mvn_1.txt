mvn_1
* first install jdk in your system 
* set java environmental variable
* after that extract maven files in your local system
* set maven environmental variable
* in maven evry different project has different folder structure
    we have to create folder structure
* we'll execute a command, based upon our project we
   select a project which matches to our project
      1. Open cmd with your maven folder path
      2. type mvn archetype:generate  ; you'll
            get a list of projects
      3. select a project number
          select a version num
          give group id, artifact id (based on your art_id a folder will create in that the folder structure will be created)
          give version name
          give package name (package name and groupid name are always same)
          conform the configuaration by giving yes
* you'll get build success message.
   with your artifact_id it will create a folder
   
* If you open that folder, there will be src and pom.xml
     files 
         in src, besed on your group_id. a folder 
          will be there
      POM.XML (project object management tool)
            in this maven co-ordinates like
              group_id, artifact_id, etc... 
              well as meta data, build information 
              i.e. executable file info, dependancies, 
              resources everything will be in it.
     all it will create automatically, but in ant you
      have to create it manually
* what and all in pom.xml, that is for folder structure
   program
* Now to execute goals: In maven 23 phases are there
      regularly we use 4 or 5
         In that 1. validate
                        to check weather the data is 
                          validate or not
                 2. compile
                 3. test
                 4. package
                 5. integration-test
                 6. verify
                 7. install
                 8. deploye
